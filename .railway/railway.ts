/**
 * Railway Infrastructure as Code for railway-todo-app.
 *
 * One file describes the whole environment: the Postgres database, the app
 * service built from this GitHub repository, and the variables wiring them
 * together. Apply it with the Railway CLI:
 *
 *   railway login && railway link      # once per machine
 *   railway config plan                # preview
 *   railway config apply               # create/update resources
 *
 * Secrets are never written here: `preserve()` keeps whatever value is set in
 * Railway (dashboard or `railway variable set`), and the plan output redacts
 * values by default.
 *
 * To reuse this for another app, change REPO, APP_NAME and REGION.
